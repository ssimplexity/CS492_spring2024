Course Description
-------------------
Most computational problems are NP-hard, and we cannot expect to solve them (i) optimally (ii) in polynomial-time (iii) on all instances. In this course, we study algorithm design paradigms which relax some of the criteria (i)-(iii) for a desirable algorithm. Specifically, we present techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms in the frameworks of parameterized complexity, approximation and exact exponential algorithms. We examine how such techniques are implemented as algorithms for concrete problems using the structure of a problem instance or a solution. The notions of hardness, which says that there is a limit on how efficiently some problems can be solved under some computational complexity assumption, are introduced as well.

- Recommended Prerequisite: 
Discrete Mathematics (CS204), Data Structure (CS206), Introduction to Algorithms (CS300).

- Course Materials.
