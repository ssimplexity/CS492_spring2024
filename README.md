- Lecture Room: 2443 in Building E3
  
- Schedule: 
  - On-site lectures, Tuesday and Thursday 9:00-10:30.
  - 18-22 March: No lecture (a makeup class will be scheduled or other lectures will be stretched).
  - 15-19 April: Midterm exam.
  - 10-14 June: Final exam.
     
- Office hour: Wednesday 10:30-12:00 at 3406 E3-1.

- Grading: 
  - Homeworks, Participation, Quiz 20%, Project 10%, Midterm exam 35%, Final exam 35%.
  - Project: Students choose a subject related with the course (e.g. a section from the textbooks used in the class, classic or recent papers), and produce a short video explaining the material. One can form a team consisting of up to three students.
  - Participants of the [PACE Challenge 2024](https://pacechallenge.org/2024/) with qualified solutions will get 10% bonus credits on top of their final credits.
  
 
- Others:
  - The official language in the class is English. 
  - The solutions to homeworks should be written either in latex (highly recommended) or in text editor. Hand-written solutions are not accepted.
  - A strict policy against cheating, copying (either from peer students or from materials on the internet or on print) and other dishonest behaviors will be applied; expect an "F" grade. 


Course Description
-------------------
Most computational problems are NP-hard, and we cannot expect to solve them (i) optimally (ii) in polynomial-time (iii) on all instances. In this course, we study algorithm design paradigms which relax some of the criteria (i)-(iii) for a desirable algorithm. Specifically, we present techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms in the frameworks of parameterized complexity, approximation and exact exponential algorithms. We examine how such techniques are implemented as algorithms for concrete problems using the structure of a problem instance or a solution. The notions of hardness, which says that there is a limit on how efficiently some problems can be solved under some computational complexity assumption, are introduced as well.

- Recommended Prerequisite: 
Discrete Mathematics (CS204), Data Structure (CS206), Introduction to Algorithms (CS300).
